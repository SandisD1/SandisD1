### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Sandis Dreimanis.

I am a software developer currently creating Java and Spring boot applications.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Spring Boot app "Flight planner" which allows for the user to store information about flights (their departure/arrival cities and times/dates) and retrieve, search for and sort such information.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more and more about Java and Spring boot application design every day.
